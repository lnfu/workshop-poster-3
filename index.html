            <h2>About the Event</h2>
            <p>This is an event co-held by iGEM team KCL & team NYCU_Formosa, in the aim to promote synthetic biology to
                the public via the media of BioArt.</p>
            <p>BioArt, generally speaking, is the art made of biological substances or the art that comments on the
                biological materials. It pushes the boundaries between art and science, and also plays an essential role
                in raising bioethics and social environmental issues. </p>
            <p>In <i>BioArt Workshop_ Phase 2</i> , we have invited BioArtists <b>Dr. Gill Brown</b> from the UK to give
                inspiring speeches!</p>
            <p>Science communicators and Gill will be talking about her career in science and graphic design, hightlight her collaborative work with scientists at King's.</p>
